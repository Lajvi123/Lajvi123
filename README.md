## 👋 Hi, I'm Lajvi 

🎓 Master's student in Computer Science at Rice University (GPA: 3.8)  
📍 Houston, TX  
📊 Aspiring Data Scientist | Data Analyst  

I am passionate about transforming messy, real-world data into meaningful insights that drive business and operational decisions. I enjoy working with raw and unstructured datasets—cleaning, preprocessing, and engineering features to build reliable analytical and predictive models.

My work focuses on statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and building scalable data pipelines using Python and SQL.  I am currently seeking entry-level Data Scientist and Data Analyst roles where I can apply my skills to deliver measurable impact.
