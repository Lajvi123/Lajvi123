## 👋 Hi, I'm Lajvi 

🎓 Master's student in Computer Science at Rice University (GPA: 3.8)  
📍 Houston, TX  
📊 Aspiring Data Scientist | Data Analyst  

I’m the kind of person who actually enjoys the "messy" part of data. I like taking thousands of raw, unorganized records and figuring out how to clean them up so they actually tell a story. To me, the most interesting part of Data Science isn’t just the final model—it’s the work that goes into making the data reliable enough to trust.

I spend most of my time working in Python and SQL. Right now, I am looking for a full-time Data Scientist or Data Analyst role where I can help solve real-world problems with data.
