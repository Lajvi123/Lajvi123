## 👋 Hi, I'm Lajvi 

🎓 Master's student in Computer Science at Rice University (GPA: 3.8)  
📍 Houston, TX  
📊 Aspiring Data Scientist | Data Analyst  

I am passionate about transforming messy, real-world data into meaningful insights that drive business and operational decisions. I enjoy working with raw and unstructured datasets—cleaning, preprocessing, and engineering features to build reliable analytical and predictive models.

My work focuses on statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and building scalable data pipelines using Python and SQL.  I am currently seeking entry-level Data Scientist and Data Analyst roles where I can apply my skills to deliver measurable impact.



## 📂 Data Science Projects   

### Supply Chain Disruption Prediction 

* Designed and deployed a scalable data ingestion pipeline that extracted and transformed real-world and synthetic data from MongoDB Atlas, covering weather anomalies, shipping routes, and geopolitical conflicts.
  
* Currently preparing on Training disruption-prediction models (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost), selecting the best by validation accuracy, and deploying it via a real-time web app (FastAPI / Flask) that will return a disruption risk score from user shipment inputs.

### Security Log Anomaly Detection  

* Built a data pipeline to preprocess **140K+ UNSW-NB15** network logs and simulate near real-time scoring for suspicious activity detection.
  
* Deployed an **Isolation Forest** predictive model with **82% test accuracy**, generating anomaly scores to prioritize high-risk events related to fraud detection.

### VQA System for Healthcare

* Conducted a **comparative analysis of multi-modal models** (ResNet/Swin + LSTM/BERT) for **Visual Question Answering** using NLP techniques on a custom dataset of brain and breast medical images, evaluating performance across diverse question categories.
  
* Trained and compared encoder pairs using PyTorch, PySpark, Tensorflow to evaluate performance across multiple medical question types (e.g., tumor location, presence, type, and scan region), achieving highest test accuracy of 89.54% with Swin+BERT.
