## 👋 Hi, I'm Lajvi 

🎓 Master's student in Computer Science at Rice University (GPA: 3.8)  
📍 Houston, TX  
📊 Aspiring Data Scientist | Data Analyst  

I’m the kind of person who actually enjoys the "messy" part of data. I like taking thousands of raw, unorganized records and figuring out how to clean them up so they actually tell a story. To me, the most interesting part of Data Science isn’t just the final model—it’s the work that goes into making the data reliable enough to trust.

I spend most of my time working in Python and SQL. Right now, I am looking for a full-time Data Scientist or Data Analyst role where I can help solve real-world problems with data



## 📂 Data Science Projects   

### Supply Chain Disruption Prediction 

* Designed and deployed a scalable data ingestion pipeline that extracted and transformed real-world and synthetic data from MongoDB Atlas, covering weather anomalies, shipping routes, and geopolitical conflicts.
  
* Currently preparing on Training disruption-prediction models (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost), selecting the best by validation accuracy, and deploying it via a real-time web app (FastAPI / Flask) that will return a disruption risk score from user shipment inputs.

### Security Log Anomaly Detection  

* Built a data pipeline to preprocess **140K+ UNSW-NB15** network logs and simulate near real-time scoring for suspicious activity detection.
  
* Deployed an **Isolation Forest** predictive model with **82% test accuracy**, generating anomaly scores to prioritize high-risk events related to fraud detection.

### VQA System for Healthcare

* Compared different model pairs (like ResNet and BERT) to see which one could best answer questions about medical scans. Ended up hitting 89.5% accuracy.
  
* Trained and compared encoder pairs using PyTorch, PySpark, Tensorflow to evaluate performance across multiple medical question types (e.g., tumor location, presence, type, and scan region), achieving highest test accuracy of 89.54% with Swin+BERT.
